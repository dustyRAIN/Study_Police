# Study_Police
The purpose of this project is to monitor the study time. The project is available as an android app (working) and as a website (partially done). The project will be able to recognize a user and identify the amount of time he/she has read. It uses [face recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) api and can also track eyes to confirm whether a reader is actually reading or not. The idea is based on classroom system like [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com). Any user can open up a classroom and upload materials in it. Students in this classroom can access those materials and read them using the app or the website. Meanwhile, their facial information will be tracked to recognize the reader if he/she the actual user. Inside a class, the creator can monitor the statistics about the reading time of the students and the amount of time a material is read.
